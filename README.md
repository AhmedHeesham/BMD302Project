pet clinic
Pet clinics are regarded as one of the most essential
clinics owing to the significance of animal health since
many people own pets and expose their children to
these animals on a regular basis. As a result, we want
to create a desktop program for managing
veterinarianâ€™s workflow. This system is required to
keep track of patients, appointments, procedures, and
medicines. The desktop application is made by C# (.NET
framework).
